"responsive" is a lab in which a website prints
1) "Dice" when loaded on a device of my choosing
2) "No dice" when loaded on another browser

The device of my choosing is the iPhone 4, since
that is the device that I possess!

My solution correctly displays "No dice" when opened on
my laptop browswer and "Dice" when opened on my iPhone.

I did not collaborate with anyone on this project.

This lab took me 1-2 hours (almost entirely spent on 
figuring out Git. Why!)
