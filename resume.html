				Microprocessor Architecture & Assembly Programming,
				Analog Electronics, Medical Instrumentation Design
				
				<h2>Senior Design Group Project - Tonography for Patients with Glaucoma</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Redesigning an outdated tonometry device
					used to evaluate glaucoma risk in patients 
					by measuring the optical fluid pressure in the eye</li>
					<li>Developing a working prototype that includes 
					associated methods to digitally receive, interpret,
					and display the data obtained from the device,
					ideally through wireless communication</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Assembler for a simple MIPS machine</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Designed and implemented an assembler
					using Python to translate any MIPS program</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Maze Game Project</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Programmed the Motorola HCS12 microcontroller in assembly - using
					knowledge of execution time, I/O, and interrupts - to implement a maze
					game displayed on an LED array on the 68HC12 evaluation board</li>
				</ul>					
				<h2>VLSI Design: 8-bit Carry Look Ahead Adder (0.6um Technology)</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Designed, down to the layout level, a CMOS chip for a high-speed
					8-bit adder utilizing dual-rail domino logic and customized CLA adder
					architecture with Manchester Carry Chains using the Cadence design tool</li>
					<li>Verified circuit functionality using Verilog and Spectre simulations</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>

				<h1>Work Experience</h1>
				<h2>IBM T.J. Watson Research Center</h2>
				Research Intern, Central Scientific Services Electronics Dept. June-August 2012 
				<ul>
					<li>Developed a text processing tool in Python that takes PCB design files
					as input and then - based on a minimized required number of user entries -
					intelligently and automatically selects key data that could accurately 
					represent the surface mount devices (SMDs) to be used on the board and 
					translates them into multiple output files</li>
					<li>Designed a facility to produce a manufacturing Bill-Of-Materials
					in both CSV and HTML formats as well as a set of machine-compatible
					information labels corresponding to all of the board components to be
					read in by the automated "pick & place" PCB assembly machine, drastically
					reducing man hours in automating the preparation process as well as making
					the editing process more flexible and efficient</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Tufts University Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering</h2>
				Undergraduate Researcher, February-July 2011 
				<ul>
					<li>Investigated the use of a low-power plasma source at 
					atmospheric pressure to deposit diamondlike carbon thin films</li>
					<li>Designed a plasma enclosure using SolidWorks to 
					improve gas purity and experimental repeatability</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Camp Wekeela for Boys and Girls</h2>
				Bunk Counselor and Sports Instructor, June-August 2010 
				<ul>
					<li>Guided and mentored campers ages 6-16</li>
