					<h1>Work Experience</h1>
					<h2>IBM T.J. Watson Research Center</h2>
					<i>Research Intern, Central Scientific Services Electronics Dept.</i> June-August 2012 
					<ul>
						<li>Developed a text processing tool in Python that takes PCB design files
						as input and then - based on a minimized required number of user entries -
						intelligently and automatically selects key data that could accurately 
						represent the surface mount devices (SMDs) to be used on the board and 
						translates them into multiple output files</li>
						<li>Designed a facility to produce a manufacturing Bill-Of-Materials
						in both CSV and HTML formats as well as a set of machine-compatible
						information labels corresponding to all of the board components to be
						read in by the automated "pick & place" PCB assembly machine, drastically
						reducing man hours in automating the preparation process as well as making
						the editing process more flexible and efficient</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Tufts University Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering</h2>
					<i>Undergraduate Researcher,</i> February-July 2011 
					<ul>
						<li>Investigated the use of a low-power plasma source at 
						atmospheric pressure to deposit diamondlike carbon thin films</li>
						<li>Designed a plasma enclosure using SolidWorks to 
						improve gas purity and experimental repeatability</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Camp Wekeela for Boys and Girls</h2>
					<i>Bunk Counselor and Sports Instructor,</i> June-August 2010 
					<ul>
						<li>Guided and mentored campers ages 6-16</li>
