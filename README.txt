README file for Assignment 1
Mical Nobel

1.  I think I did a good job with the CSS.
	I could have improved upon the mobile version
	more if it didn't take me a really long time
	to figure out how to change between media types!
	Also some other little things I would have improved
	upon if I hadn't run out of time. Might come back
	to this later for funzies.
	
2. I did not collaborate with anyone for this assignment.

3. I spent approx. 5-6 hours on this.
