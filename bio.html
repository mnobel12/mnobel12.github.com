					<h1 align="middle">About me...</h1>
					I was born on a stormy summer night in the city of Manhattan.<br/>
					I soon moved to the suburbs with my parents and two sisters. <br/>
					I have two dogs, Ofek and Oliver. They are both absurd. <br/>
					When I was 10 years old I promised to myself that I would never
					build another circuit in my life, after a section on building simple 
					light-builb circuits in my fifth grade class. Now I am a senior Electrical
					Engineering student at Tufts. Oops!<br/>
